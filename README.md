# XML-Best-Practice
Work on best practice for XML schemas, validation and example for ISO/TC211
_ISO/TC 211 standards are model driven, being based on the UML model that defines packages, classes and attributes.
The XML implementations of those standards attempt to reproduce those models as schemas._
XML (eXtensible Markup Lanuage) provides a mechanism to transfer information and data in a structured way. The use of XML schemas further enhaces that tranfer by ensuring that the records that conform to that schema will tranfer the data in the order that the schema specifies and contains only the allowable values and always the mandatory ones. XML is very samble and is capable of transfering large pay-loads and dealing with very complex schemas.
Schemas that ISO/TC 211 promote are of two types, those that provide metadata about a set of data, and those that provide the data itself.
In the past ISO/TC 211 has focused predominantly on the former, with the range of ISO 19115 metadata standards.
