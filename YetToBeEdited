<h2>Borrowed pages, yet to be edited </h2>
<p>Care must be taken as, although namespace prefixes do not need
						to be unique, namespace clashes occur when two or more different
						namespace URIs attempt to use the same prefix within an
						implementation.<br/>
						Please refere to https://www.w3schools.com/XML/xml_namespaces.asp
					</p>
					<p>There is no real reason why
						XML schemas should not use the namespace prefix for their target
						namespace as it reduces ambiguity and increases readability. A
						namespace prefix may be omitted in XML <u>files</u> that are
						intended for the transference of large volumes of data. Noting
						that due to the complex interactions between most TC 211
						schemas, rarely will only one namespace be present in a data
						file, so some prefixes are likely to be required.</p>
					<p>ISO&nbsp;19103&nbsp;Edition&nbsp;2:2024 has
						now replaced the withdrawn ISO&quot;19103:2015, with an expectation
						that all schemas generated by new projects will be consistent
						with ISO&nbsp;19103&nbsp;Edition&nbsp;2:2024.</p>
					<p>Changes that have come about
						by the replacement of ISO&nbsp;19103:2015 by ISO&nbsp;19103&nbsp;Edition&nbsp;2:2024, 
						have required that classifiers previously implemented
						with the namespace prefix “gco” need to be recoded and
						published. As those classifiers are used ubiquitously throughout
						the TC211 XML schemas and it will take some time for all schemas
						to be refreshed, there would be a high risk of namespace clashes
						if the new implementations were also to use “gco”. The new
						implementations use “cdt” (derived from package “Core Data
						Types” used in the Harmonised Model) as the namespace prefix.
						The URI for that set of XML classifiers will start as:
						xmlns:cdt=”https://schemas.isotc211.org/xml/19103/-/2/cdt/1”.</p>
